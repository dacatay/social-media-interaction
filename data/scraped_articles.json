(DRT), are designed to locate cellphones within a certain range by emulating a cell tower.\n\nThe specific model obtained by the Texas National Guard, known as the DRT 1301C, is even capable of intercepting and recording phone calls in real-time.\n\nA leaked U.S. government catalogue of cellphone surveillance devices obtained by The Intercept in 2015 also notes the ability of the DRT 1301C, nicknamed the \u201cdirt box,\u201d to \u201clocate up to 10,000 targets and can process multiple analog and digital wireless devices all at the same time.\u201d\n\nThe Observer notes that the dirt boxes were installed in two RC-26 surveillance planes used for counternarcotics operations.\n\nQuestions have now begun to arise over the legality of the Texas National Guard\u2019s actions given their intended role and mission scope.\n\n\u201c[T]he Texas National Guard is a military force under the governor\u2019s command, not law enforcement,\u201d del Bosque writes. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear under what legal authorities the State Guard would be operating to conduct electronic eavesdropping.\u201d\n\nWhen questioned by the Observer, the Texas National Guard reportedly refused to explain how or if it had obtained a warrant prior to using the devices.\n\nGovernment agencies who have purchased similar technology in the past have pointed to nondisclosure agreements with the manufacturers as reasoning for keeping knowledge of the devices hidden from the public.\n\nGiven the technology\u2019s ability to gather wide swaths of data, civil liberties advocates fear that countless innocent cell phone users are being affected while the dirt boxes are in use.\n\n\u201cThese DRT boxes are far more capable than the old Stingrays,\u201dAustin-based attorney Scott McCollough told the Observer. \u201cThe old-style Stingrays were not able to capture content. Guess what? The DRT box is\u2026 These newer ones get everything.\u201d\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has found that law enforcement in at least 24 states is currently employing the technology.\n\nGot a tip?

Kelley struck his stepson so hard he fractured his skull.\n\n\u201cHe assaulted his stepson severely enough that he fractured his skull, and he also assaulted his wife,\u201d retired colonel Don Christensen, formerly the chief prosecutor for the Air Force, told the The New York Times. \u201cHe pled to intentionally doing it.\u201d\n\nAs punishment, Kelley was confined in military prison 12 months, received a reduction in military rank and was discharged for \u201cbad conduct\u201d -- a step above a dishonorable discharge.\n\nKelley, who was described to Fox News by a childhood friend as a \u201chappy, caring person,\u201d was separately charged in August 2014 for animal cruelty.\n\nHe had jumped on and repeatedly punched his pet Husky -- an underweight puppy -- while he was living in a trailer park in Colorado Springs, Colorado, KMGH reported. Kelley denied beating the dog and said he jumped on it because it was acting aggressively toward another dog.\n\nHe was also the focus of a protective order issued in Colorado in 2015.\n\nDEVIN PATRICK KELLEY SERVED IN AIR FORCE, WAS COURT-MARTIALED FOR ASSAULTING WIFE, CHILD\n\nAuthorities believe Kelley used a Ruger AR-556 rifle when he committed the deadliest shooting at a church in modern U.S. history. Authorities found that rifle at the church, while two handguns were recovered from Kelley\u2019s vehicle.\n\nOfficials said hundreds of shell casings and 15 magazines with 30 rounds each were found at the church.\n\nAcademy Sports + Outdoors, a chain sporting goods store, told Fox News in a statement that Kelley had purchased two guns from two of their locations, both in San Antonio, on separate dates.\n\n\u201cBased on information we received from law enforcement, we confirmed that the suspect purchased two firearms from two San Antonio locations, one in 2016 and one in 2017,\" the statement read. \"We also confirmed that both sales were approved by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). We are cooperating with law enforcement as they investigate further.\u201d\n\nThose who are given a bad conduct discharge from the military are not barred from legally purchasing weapons.\n\nA 1968 Gun Control Act made it unlawful for a licensed firearms deal to sell weapons to those who received a dishonorable discharge -- not a bad conduct discharge. Since Kelley was discharged on bad conduct, the law was not triggered.\n\nHowever, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Monday on \u201cFOX & Friends\u201d that Kelley was denied a gun permit in the state.\n\n\"He was rejected either because he did not fully answer all the questions that are required to get a Texas gun permit, or he answered those questions wrong, that we still don't know,\" Abbott said.\n\nFederal officials said Monday night that the Air Force didn't submit Kelley's domestic assault conviction into a national database that's used to conduct background checks, as required by the Pentagon.\n\nAn autopsy of Kelley's body found three gunshot wounds: one self-inflicted to the head and two -- one in the leg, another in the torso -- from the armed citizen who chased after him.\n\nFox News' Shira Bush and Madeline Farber and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "link": "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/11/06/texas-church-shooter-reportedly-fractured-stepsons-skull-on-purpose.html", "published": "2017-11-06T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Anti-Trump media makes up fake story about overfeeding fish at Japanese koi pond", "text": "President Trump and Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe carried on an old tradition of feeding carp at a Koi pond in Tokyo when CNN and the rest of the mainstream media decided to twist the narrative to make Trump appear like a buffoon.\n\nLiberal network CNN ran a ridiculous headline, \u201cTrump feeds fish, winds up pouring entire box of food into Koi pond,\u201d complete with a misleading tweet from reporter Veronica Rocha that only shows the Trump dumping the entire box of food. Her footage is conveniently edited to skip Abe doing the same thing.\n\nIN fact, Abe dumped his entire box of fish food into the pond and Trump followed while the Prime Minister of Japan smiled. However, the anti-Trump media has been cropping the video to only show Trump\u2019s actions.\n\nBloomberg White House correspondent Justin Sink tweeted that Trump and Abe were \u201cspooning fish food into the pond\u201d when Trump \u201cdecided to just dump the whole box in for the fish.\u201d The problem with the attempt to paint Trump as an animal-abusing, lazy America is that Japan's Prime Minister did the exact same thing seconds before.\n\nBuzzFeed News ran a story headlined, \u201cThis photo of Trump dumping his carp food in a pond in japan has become a huge meme,\u201d and embedded a series of Japanese tweets mocking the president. The Guardian even ran a story about the dangers of overfeeding fish.\n\n\u201cWhite House reporters, keen perhaps to pick up on a Trump gaffe, captured the moment when he upended his box on their smartphones and tweeted evidence of his questionable grasp of fish keeping,\u201d The Guardian wrote. \u201cSome speculated that a poor palace employee would be dispatched to the scene to clean up the mess as soon as the two leaders disappeared inside.\u201d\n\nForeign dignitaries have been feeding the fish in the koi pond for years, but Trump did not lose patience, despite what the media wants the narrative to be. He was literally emulating Abe with his actions.\n\nOne Twitter user wrote, \u201cAbe is basically watching in polite rage-horror as the epic orange buffoon tries to kill his fish,\u201d but she clearly didn\u2019t see the entire video, while the New York Daily News said, \u201cThe former New York City real estate tycoon got a little heavy handed while feeding koi.\u201d\n\nBrian Flood covers the media for Fox News.
